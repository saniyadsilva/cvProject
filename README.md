This project demonstrates real-time face detection using a pre-trained deep learning model and OpenCV in Python. It detects human faces from a webcam or video feed and highlights them with bounding boxes.

# Features

- Real-time face detection using a deep learning-based detector
- Accurate and fast detection even with multiple faces
- Uses MobileNet-based SSD model (trained on face data)
